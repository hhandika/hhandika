As an evolutionary biologist and taxonomist, Iâ€™ve found a unique intersection between my field of study and my passion for programming. Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing my PhD at [Esselstyn's Lab](https://esselstyn.github.io/), Louisiana State University, USA. My programming projects are primarily focused on developing tools to improve the accessibility of evolutionary studies.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a keen interest in computer hardware and software, often spending time building and tinkering with computers. My adventurous side takes me to tropical mountains where I conduct field research, studying rodents and shrews in their natural habitats.
