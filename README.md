# Hello | Halo... ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught programmer, and a taxonomist and field evolutionary biologist by training. I enjoy computer building and tinkering with computer hardware and software. You also often find me chasing mice and shrews on a mountain in the tropics. I am a PhD student in [Esselstyn's Lab](https://esselstyn.github.io/) at Louisiana State University, USA. 

My programming projects are centered around developing tools for phylogenomic studies. Now, I am mostly use Rust, but I am also familiar with other programming languages. Below is a glimpse of top 7 programming languagues I use. The list is pulled from my public repos (~1/3 of my repos stored on Github). It does not reflect my expertise in a certain language. Nonetheless, it may give some ideas of programming languages that I am familiar with.
