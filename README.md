### Hello Wonderful World... ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught programmer, and a taxonomist and field evolutionary biologist by training. I enjoy computer building and tinkering with computer hardware and software. You also often find me chasing mice and shrews on a mountain in the tropics. Currently, I am a PhD student in [Esselstyn's Lab](https://esselstyn.github.io/) at Louisiana State University, USA. I work on morphological systematics and molecular phylogenetics of small mammals in Southeast Asia. I revise their taxonomy, describe new species, and study their evolutionary relationships. My programming projects are developing tools to suppport my research.

Below is a glimpse of programming languagues I use. The list is pulled from my public repos (~1/3 of my repos stored on Github). It does not reflect my expertise in a certain language. Nonetheless, it may give some ideas of programming languages that I am familiar with.
