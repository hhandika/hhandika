# b"Hello" | b"Halo..." 👋

You can call me Heru or Hez. My programming projects primarily focus on developing tools to improve the efficiency and accessibility of biodiversity research. I specialize in developing high-performance, memory-efficient tools that can scale from mobile devices and personal computers to [HPC clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing). I prioritize developing software that’s user-friendly and cost-effective to develop and maintain.
