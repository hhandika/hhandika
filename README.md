# b"Hello" | b"Halo..." 👋

As an evolutionary biologist and taxonomist, I’ve found a unique intersection between my field of study and my passion for programming. I’m currently pursuing my PhD at [Esselstyn's Lab](https://esselstyn.github.io/) at Louisiana State University, USA. My programming projects primarily focus on developing tools to improve the accessibility of evolutionary studies.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am keenly interested in computer hardware and software, often spending time building and tinkering with computers. My adventurous side takes me to tropical mountains, where I conduct field research, studying rodents and shrews in their natural habitats.
