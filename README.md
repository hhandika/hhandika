I am an evolutionary biologist and taxonomist by training, but I have had a passion for programming since I was a teenager. Iâ€™m pursuing my PhD at [Esselstyn's Lab](https://esselstyn.github.io/), Louisiana State University, USA. My programming projects primarily focus on developing tools to improve the accessibility of evolutionary studies.
