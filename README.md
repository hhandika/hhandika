# b"Hello" | b"Halo..." ðŸ‘‹

You can call me Heru or Hez. Iâ€™m pursuing my PhD at [Esselstyn's Lab](https://esselstyn.github.io/), Louisiana State University, USA. My programming projects primarily focus on developing tools to improve the accessibility and inclusivity of evolutionary studies. I create high-performance and memory-efficient tools that scale to many platforms. I look for ways to make software for the field easier for users with limited technical knowledge and support.
