# b"Hello" | b"Halo..." ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught programmer, and a taxonomist and field evolutionary biologist by training. I enjoy computer building and tinkering with computer hardware and software. You also often find me chasing mice and shrews on a mountain in the tropics. I am a PhD student in [Esselstyn's Lab](https://esselstyn.github.io/) at Louisiana State University, USA. My programming projects are centered around developing tools for phylogenomic studies. I use [RustðŸ¦€](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for most projects, especially when performance is critical. I am, however, also a big proponent of using "the right tool for the job".
