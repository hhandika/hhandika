### Hello Wonderful World... ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught programmer, taxonomist and field evolutionary biologist by training. I enjoy computer building and tinkering with computer hardware and software. You will also often find me chasing mice and shrews on a mountain in the tropics. Let just say, I am someone who was failed to get into a computer science major, decided to study biology instead, and realized that it was the best decision I had ever made in my life.

Currently, I am a PhD student in Esselstyn's Lab at the Museum of Natural Science and the Department of Biological Sciences, Louisiana State University, USA. I work on morphological systematics and molecular phylogenetics of small mammals in Southeast Asia. I revise their taxonomy, describe new species, and study their evolutionary relationships. My current coding projects are mainly to support my research.
