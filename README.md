You can call me Heru or Hez. My programming projects primarily focus on developing tools to improve the efficiency and accessibility of biodiversity studies. I create high-performance and memory-efficient tools that scale to many platforms. I look for ways to make software for the field more accessible for users with limited technical knowledge and support, while keeping the development costs low.
