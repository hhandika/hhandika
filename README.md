I am a self-taught programmer && taxonomist and field biologist by training. 

I am a PhD student in Esselstyn's Lab at the Museum of Natural Science and the Department of Biological Sciences, Louisiana State University, USA. I work mostly on taxonomy and molecular phylogenetic of rodents in Southeast Asia. My current coding projects are largely to support my research.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Rust-based project to create a pipeline to assemble sequence capture genetic data. During my free time, I work on coding data science statistics from scratch. I implement it on six programming languanges that I am comfortable on using.
