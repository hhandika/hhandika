I am a self-taught programmer, a taxonomist and field evolutionary biologist by training. I enjoy computer building and tinkering with computer hardware and software. You also often find me chasing mice and shrews on a mountain in the tropics. I am a PhD student in [Esselstyn's Lab](https://esselstyn.github.io/) at Louisiana State University, USA.

My programming projects are centered around developing tools for biological studies. I consider myself language agnostic. As needed, I always enjoy learning new programming languages and framework. Find out more about me on [my website](https://hhandika.com/)!
