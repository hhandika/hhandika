### Hello Wonderful World... ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught programmer, taxonomist and field evolutionary biologist by training. I enjoy computer building and tinkering with computer hardware and software. You will also often find me chasing mice and shrews on a mountain in the tropics. I am a PhD student in [Esselstyn's Lab](https://esselstyn.github.io/) at [the Museum of Natural Science](https://www.lsu.edu/mns/) and [the Department of Biological Sciences](https://www.lsu.edu/science/biosci/), Louisiana State University, USA. I work on morphological systematics and molecular phylogenetics of small mammals in Southeast Asia. I revise their taxonomy, describe new species, and study their evolutionary relationships. My current coding projects are mainly to support my research.
