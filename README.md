I am a self-taught programmer && taxonomist and field biologist by training. I am a PhD student in Esselstyn's Lab at the Museum of Natural Science and the Department of Biological Sciences, Louisiana State University, USA. I work mostly on taxonomy and molecular phylogenetic of rodents in Southeast Asia.
